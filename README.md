# Solar System - An Exercise for Practicing Project Collaboration in git

[ ![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png) ](https://xkcd.com/1597/)

## Goal
Your team will become comfortable collaborating with git (unlike Cueball!).

## Objective
Using git, you and your team collaborate to deliver changes to a code base, eventually culminating in a static page somewhat like the one in this repo's `sample-solution-static-page` directory.

## Overview
Your team lead will create a repo and share it with the team, who will collaboratively add features and deliver them on `main`,

Your team will make changes by adding and modifying static HTML and CSS files.  The only "webserver" is your filesystem.

As your team begins to deliver completed tasks, you will run into challenges (merge conflicts!) associated with working in parallel on a code base, and you will practice using git to solve them.

The actual code changes are purposely kept very simple; the goal here is not so much to learn new coding concepts, but to learn new git-based code collaboration skills .

Keep the page working as you deliver each change to `master`. &nbsp;&nbsp;Don't "break the build"!
