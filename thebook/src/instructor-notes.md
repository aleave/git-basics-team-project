# Instructor notes

## [Sample project repo](https://github.com/walquis/git-basics-sample-project-repo)
- Commits in this repo are a source for ideas of what kind of work teams can do.
- Ned, Nykhia, Dex, Deja, Xavier

## Overview
- In session 1, lessons introduce material organized around TERMS and COMMANDS from the syllabus.
- Session 2 is primarily project time for practicing git skills in a moderately structured exercise.

### Housekeeping items
- Take breaks every 30-45 minutes.
- At checkpoints, have the class use Zoom's green-checkbox and red-X "reactions" buttons.  For instance, "Who has your team's repo cloned locally?  Give me a green checkbox if yes, red-X if no."  _NOTE: Unlike the quick-reaction icons along the top, these responses will stay up until the students take them down._
- They can also use the "speed up" and "slow down" buttons.
