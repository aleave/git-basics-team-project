# Orientation on project's starter code

You'll practice your git skills by developing a simple website collaboratively.

During the prework, in [Git Environment Setup](/prework/env-setup.md), you cloned a couple of repos:
1. A sample of the "Solar System" website: [https://github.com/walquis/git-basics-sample-project-repo](https://github.com/walquis/git-basics-sample-project-repo).
1. A "starter" repo for that website:
[https://github.com/walquis/git-basics-starter-repo](https://github.com/walquis/git-basics-starter-repo).

The starter repo has these resources:
- Initial versions of `index.html`, `faq.html`, `about.html`, `help.html`, and `map.html`.
- A folder with images (notice that they are not yet used in the starter website's code).
- CSS files (similarly, they are not yet used).

The starter repo's `index.html` has the beginnings of a menu, but it's incomplete.

Feel free to compare the code in each repo to get a better idea of what work needs to be done.  For instance, open each repo's index.html in your browser, via "File --> Open File...".

Also, open each repo in Visual Studio Code, and look at the code.

When your team gets going, you'll [break the work into tasks](/session2/add-features.md) to build out the starter repo so it looks something like the sample website.

NOTE: For now, during this prework, you'll make changes locally in this copy of `git-basics-starter-repo`, and **then delete the entire repo**[^or-copy-elsewhere].  When the class starts, your team lead will fork `git-basics-starter-repoz` into their Github account (calling it something like `solar-system`), and you'll re-clone the repo from your team lead's fork.
