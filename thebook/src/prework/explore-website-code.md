# Explore the website's code

During [Git Environment Setup](/prework/env-setup.md), you cloned a couple of repos:
1. A sample of the "Solar System" website: https://github.com/walquis/git-basics-sample-project-repo.
1. A "starter" repo for that website: https://github.com/walquis/git-basics-starter-repo.

The primary objective in this class is, of course, to learn git.  The secondary objective is to learn git by **collaboratively turning the starter repo into the "Solar System" website**.

Compare the code in each repo to get an idea of what work needs to be done.  For instance, open index.html from each repo in your browser, via "File --> Open File...".

Also, open each repo in Visual Studio Code, and look at the source.

The starter repo has these resources:
- Initial versions of `index.html`, `faq.html`, `about.html`, `help.html`, and `map.html`.
- A folder with images (but notice that they are not yet used in the starter website's code).
- CSS files (similarly, they are not yet used).

The starter repo's `index.html` has the beginnings of a menu, but it's not complete.

And so on.

When your team gets going, you'll break the work into tasks to bring the starter repo in line with the sample website.  (And if time allows, feel free to take it further!)

For now, during this prework, you'll practice making changes locally in this starter repo, and then delete the entire git-basics-starter-repo.  When the class starts, your team lead will fork this repo, and you'll re-clone from your team lead's fork.
