# Command-line Exercises

You'll briefly cover these topics:
- `git reset`
- branching
- Merging (with no conflicts)
- Merging (where you handle a merge conflict)

## Preflight Check:
Make sure `adog` works on your \*nix command line. cd into your git-basics-starter-repo and run `adog`.  You should see something like this:
```
cd git-basics-starter-repo
adog
* 2dd739a (HEAD -> main, origin/main) Some handy git aliases, and an initial .gitignore
* 4ca41a7 Initial commit

```

If not, run this and try again:
```
alias adog='git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph'
```
