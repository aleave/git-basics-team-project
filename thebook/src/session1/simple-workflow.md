# Breakdown of Simple Collaborative Workflow
This sequence of images represents the progression of a workflow where my teammate first makes a change locally and pushes, and then I also make a change locally--but now I must integrate with their change (via a `git pull origin main`) before I too can push.

(Note that the images are arranged such that, once you're viewing one of them, you can bounce back and forth between them with right and left arrow keys, visually comparing frame-by-frame what happens between steps.)

## Step 1 - [Everybody checkout `main`](./image0.md)
## Step 2 - [Teammate commits work](./image1.md)
## Step 3 - [Teammate pushes](./image2.md)
## [Step 4 - I make local changes too](./image3.md)
### Step 5.1 - [I pull (first 1/2 - fetch)](./image4.md)
### Step 5.2 - [I pull (second 1/2 - merge)](./image5.md)
## Step 6 - [I push `main` to "origin"](./image6.md)
