Some knowledge and experience with the following material will be very helpful going into the git class.

## Basic Unix Commands

## Unix/Shell Concepts
This is the "air you breathe" when working on a computer running any variant of Unix--whether Linux, Mac OS X, Ubuntu-on-Windows, Cygwin, etc.
* The Bash shell; .bash_profile and .bashrc
* Environment Variables
* The PATH environment variable
* Standard Input (aka STDIN), Standard Output (STDOUT), Standard Error (STDERR)
