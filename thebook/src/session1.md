# Session One

Has everyone done the [Prework](prework.md)?

## Setup
1. Open your Linux shell.
1. Define your project teams.
1. **Team**: Choose a team lead.
1. **Team Lead**: Fork the starter repo.  Choose a name for it: `solar-system`, for example.
1. **Team Lead**: Invite your team as collaborators to `solar-system`.
1. **Whole Team, including Team Lead**: Clone team lead's repo (do NOT fork it!).
1. Run these commands to set up some handy aliases...
```bash
cd solar-system
source bin/git-aliases.sh
adog
```

✅ **Checkpoint: Everyone has their team lead's repo cloned (including the team lead)**.

✅ **Checkpoint: Everyone has their aliases working. (Check by running `adog` as shown above).**
