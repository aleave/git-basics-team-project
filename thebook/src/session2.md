# Session Two - Exercising your new git skills to run a project

### Intro to `git cherry-pick` -- if time
Somewhat like `git rebase`.  By default, only takes the one commit you specify and commits it to your current branch.
```
git cherry-pick a428b    # Pulls commit a428b onto your current branch
```
