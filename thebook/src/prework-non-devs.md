# Prework (For Non-Developers)

Is Git and the Bash pretty much completely new to you?

This material lays the foundation for engaging with the [Prework - For All Students](./prework.md)

## Bash
- [Fireship Learning: Bash in 100 seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4EWvMFj37g) - 100 seconds.
- [Hallden. "Linux Commands You Need to Know"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2zquYPJbWY) - 12 minutes.  Can probly put it on 2x playback without missing much.

## Git
- [Colt Steele. "Learn Git in 15 minutes"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE) - comes with a transcript and covers the right stuff in the terminal.
- [Fireship Learning. "Git it? How to use Git and Github"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdAHXoRtos) - 12 minutes. Covers the right stuff and does it in vscode in the terminal. A bonus is that it shows the fork / clone idea, which will be used in Git Basics.
- [Brad Traversy. "Git Crash Course"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWYqp7iY_Tc) - 32 minutes.
